## Members-Only Section (access restricted)

To obtain access:

1. You need a Google account to obtain access to the Members Only section of the website. This can be a Gmail address. Or you can set up a Google account using a non-gmail email address at [accounts.google.com/SignUpWithoutGmail](https://accounts.google.com/SignUpWithoutGmail)
2. Once you have a Google account, you may use the feedback link to request access to the members-only section. Bryan will then contact you using the information in the membership roster to verify your identity.
3. Once you are granted access, visit the members-only section at [members.kc23.org](https://members.kc23.org)

If you get the message “404. That’s an error,” then you likely have not yet been given access to the members site.

Feel free to contact Bryan at **407-796-1645** if you are having trouble accessing the site.
