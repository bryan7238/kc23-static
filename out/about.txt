2:T701,ABOUT OUR COUNCIL
Knights of Columbus St. John XXIII Council 13624 was founded in 2004 through the efforts of three parish priests, Rev. Charles Sullivan, Rev. Thomas Palko, and Rev. John Gilbert. We work closely with the parish by providing funds for various projects, members being active participants in their parish.

FOUNDING PRINCIPLES
The work of the Knights of Columbus is based upon our four core principles:

Charity – Our Catholic faith teaches us to “Love thy neighbor as thyself.”  Members show love for their neighbors by conducting food drives, donating food to local soup kitchens and food pantries, supporting Special Olympics and by supporting, both spiritually and materially, mothers who choose life for their babies.  Our mission and our faith compel us to action. There is no better way to experience love and compassion than by helping those in need.

Unity – None of us is as good as all of us. All members know that, together, we can accomplish far more than we can individually. We stick together and we support one another.  As a Knight, we can count on the support and encouragement of brother Knights as we work to make life better in our parishes and communities.

Fraternity – The Venerable Michael J. McGivney founded the Knights of Columbus, in large part, to provide assistance to the widows and children left behind when the family breadwinner died, often prematurely. The Knight’s top-rated insurance program continues to do this today, as do individual Knights, who have given millions of hours to assist sick and/or disabled members and their families. We have each other’s back.

Patriotism – Members of the Knights of Columbus are patriotic citizens. We are proud of our devotion to God and country, and believe in standing up for both.
